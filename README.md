# Justin Thaler ZKP Book Implementations

This repo contains toy implementations of stuff from [Justin Thaler's book](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/ProofsArgsAndZK.html) on computational proofs, arguments, and zero-knowledge. Part of the [ZKHack study group](https://github.com/thor314/pazk) held [on discord](https://discord.gg/uYTKSeT3ft).
